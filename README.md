# Single Linked List Stack Implementation

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple **stack implementation** using a **single linked list** in C++. It allows the user to perform basic stack operations like:
- Pushing values onto the stack
- Popping values from the stack
- Checking if the stack is empty
- Getting the top value of the stack
- Calculating the average of stack elements
- Displaying all elements in the stack

## Files
- **single_linked_list.hpp**: Header file that contains the template class definition for the linked list and its methods.
- **main.cpp**: Contains the main program which provides a menu for interacting with the stack.

## Prerequisites
- **g++ compiler**: Make sure you have `g++` installed on your machine. To verify, run:

  ```bash
  g++ --version

## How to compile
- To compile the program, navigate to the directory where the files main.cpp and single_linked_list.hpp are located, and run the following command:
  "g++ -o Assignment_2 main.cpp"
- After compilation, you can run the program by executing the generated binary:
  "./Assignment_2"

##Screenshots of Program

- This will display a menu with the following operations:

- 1. Checking if the Stack is Empty (When you first run the program and select 1, you will get a message saying the stack is empty):
